# merger_gui
Python Gui that allows to merge files via drag and drop. 

Most of the requirements can be installed with pip. 
Only the TkinterDnD2 library has to be installed manually.
To do this download these files:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/tkdnd/

https://sourceforge.net/projects/tkinterdnd/   (python wrapper)

Put the tkdnd2.8 directory into the tcl folder in your python directory
and put the TkinterDnD2 directory into the Libs/site-packages folder in your python directory.
